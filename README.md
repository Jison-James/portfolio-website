# Developer Portfolio

This is a single-page personal developer portfolio website created using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The portfolio showcases the developer's skills, projects, and contact information in a clean and elegant design.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the portfolio website, including sections for the header/navbar, hero, about, projects, contact, and footer. It features a typewriter effect for the hero section and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

- **style.css**: Defines the styles for the website, implementing a dark theme, responsive design, and subtle animations for various sections. It includes styles for the navbar, hero section, project cards, and contact form.

- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for the website, implementing the typewriter animation for the hero text, smooth scrolling navigation, and scroll-triggered animations for each section. It also includes a dummy function for the contact form submission.

- **assets/favicon.ico**: The favicon for the website, providing a small icon that appears in the browser tab.

- **assets/images/**: Contains images representing the sample projects listed in the projects section of the portfolio:
  - `project1.webp`
